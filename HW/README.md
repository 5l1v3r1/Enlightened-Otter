- [ ] HW
	- [ ] Move 18650 clips to fit battery
	- dont fit the battery, move by 1-2mm
	- [ ] Add pullup to NTC (LED)
	- 10k
	- [ ] Check USB footprint
	- Part didnt fit footprint that well, already changed but not tested!
	- [x] Add CC1,CC2 pulldown resistors
	- Had only one and CC1/2 connected together, ofc that didn't work
	- [ ] Check for analog design improvements
	- Analog design seems to be okay by now, will check later again :3
	- [x] Gate pulldowns
	- Gate driver has no pulldowns, unknown behaviour while not driven
	- [ ] Reduce Boost inductance
	- 15uH is too high, 3.3uH is better, also increase dc-current, maybe use this inductor https://de.rs-online.com/web/p/drahtgewickelte-smd-induktivitaten/9236194/
	- [ ] Change voltage regulator to 3.0V type
	- Is still 3.3V type in schematic, 3.0V was used for testing
	- [ ] Divide Vin voltage divider resistance by 10
	- Resistance seems to be too high, measuring falsifies the result
	- [ ] Add Mosfet to turn ESP off
	- ESP will be turned on all the time, add sleepmode and/or switched power 
	- [ ] Check schematic symbols
	- Mosfets and inductors have the wrong part numbers (mosfet has to be AO3400, inductor to be determined)
	- Change ADC voltage divider values
	- [ ] Export PCB design files to kicad and publish
	- Also export Gerber?
