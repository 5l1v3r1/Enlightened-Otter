# Enlighted-Otter

Enlighted Otter is an OSHW worklight for hacker/maker events like the chaos communication congress. It is based upon a STM32F334 with its high resolution timer as 
dual boost converter. The main goal is to provide cableless, high CRI, high brightness light with a variable color temperature.
